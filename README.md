**STEP 1:** Fork this directory (only one person of each group!)

**STEP 2:** Clone the forked directory so that each gets her copy in local

**STEP 3:** Then each one must create a new local working branch with "git branch <branch-name>" (we don't work directly on the master/main branch!)
  
```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```

**STEP 4:** Divide sections, decide who is working on what and start working each on her assigned section
  - you don't need to edit the common styles.css and navigation.css files, create a new css file for each section of the web (for example table.css, timeline.css, contactform.css)
  - rememeber to do commits of your work once in a while so that you can later go back to previous versions if needed. You can use your terminal and commands "git add ." and "git commit -m <some message>") or even better do it directly through VSCode!
 
```sh
git add .
git commit -m <some message>
```

**STEP 5:** You can also get a copy of the branches of the others if you wanna check what the others are doing. For this you need to write "git branch -a" and the "git checkout <branchname>"
